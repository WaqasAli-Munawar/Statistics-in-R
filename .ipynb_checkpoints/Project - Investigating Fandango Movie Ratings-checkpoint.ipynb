    "### Is Fandango Still Inflating Ratings?\n",
    "In October 2015, Walt Hickey from FiveThirtyEight published a [popular article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) where he presented strong evidence which suggest that Fandango's movie rating system was biased and dishonest. In this project, we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.\n",

    "\n",

    "* The movie must have had at least 30 fan ratings on Fandango's website at the time of sampling (Aug. 24, 2015).\n",
    "* The movie must have had tickets on sale in 2015.\n",

    "The sampling was clearly not random because not every movie had the same chance to be included in the sample — some movies didn't have a chance at all (like those having under 30 fan ratings or those without tickets on sale in 2015). It's questionable whether this sample is representative of the entire population we're interested to describe. It seems more likely that it isn't, mostly because this sample is subject to temporal trends — e.g. movies in 2015 might have been outstandingly good or bad compared to other years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling conditions for our other sample were (as it can be read in the README.md of [the data set's repository](https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17)):\n",
    "\n",
    "* The movie must have been released in 2016 or later.\n",

Their sampling method is called [purposive sampling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdK7N_kTzHI&feature=youtu.be) (or judgmental/selective/subjective sampling).
